### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: What do the words and structures used by Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley and Howard Phillips Lovecraft tell us about their styles ?
+ This project is conducted by Jerome Kafrouni - jk4100
+ Project summary: In this project, we learn how the three authors write, using three different approaches that each teach us about their styles. First, we look at their texts quantitatively, ie by counting characters, lengths, etc, and not looking at the words themselves. We measure the impact of these numerical attributes by using a simple Machine Learning model. We then look more closely at these authors' work by looking at what words they tend to use, in various ways. Finally, we look at the functions of these words using Part of Speech tagging. The three authors under scrutiny are known to have quite similar styles and to have influenced each other, but we'll see that, perhaps sometimes unintentionnally, they left some clues and hints in their texts that we'll make sure to leverage to analyze how they write !
